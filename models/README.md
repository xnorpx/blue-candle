# Candle YOLO v8 Model in SafeTensor Format

## Overview

This repository hosts the Candle YOLO v8 model, the smallest variant, implemented in SafeTensor format. The primary aim is to integrate this model into the blue-candle binary, allowing operation without external dependencies. Larger model variants are available for download from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/lmz/candle-yolo-v8/tree/main). Due to GitHub's limited git-lfs quota, these larger models will not be hosted in this repository.

**Upcoming Feature:** Automatic downloading of models from Huggingface within the binary is in development.

## Conversion from Torch to SafeTensor Format

**In Progress:** Detailed instructions or a script for converting models from Torch to SafeTensor format will be provided soon.

## Training Your Own Model

**To Do:** Instructions for training your own Candle YOLO v8 model will be added. This will include guidelines on dataset preparation, training parameters, and optimizing model performance.
